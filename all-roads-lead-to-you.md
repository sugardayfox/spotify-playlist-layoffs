# All roads lead to you

By Little Angels. 

## Original thought

I loved this tune for almost 3 decades now. The band never went anywhere in terms of major hits, whic doesn't seem fair. But life isn't fair, hence the inclusion of this tune in the list. 
Also, all roads lead to you could be a love song to employment. A bit twisted, but there you have it.
