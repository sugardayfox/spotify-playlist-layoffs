# The layoffs playlist on Spotify

## Why a playlist, why a repo? 

I love tomato and the amount of layoffs publicity in the tech space went on my nerves so I needed a safe space. Then I though maybe others will like it. 

Posted it on [twitter](https://twitter.com/sugardayfox/status/1594696227601502208). 

But then I thought tech folks may just like to come here and discuss it as issues.
