# Life is a highway

By Tom Cochrane

## Original thought

This is a recent addition to my favorite songs. And it wasn't any easy road to love. 

I was really big in MTV in the early, mid 90s. I explained gig that was one of the main reason in a [medium post of mine](https://medium.com/@sugardayfox/my-first-seven-jobs-or-so-part-three-vodka-and-syrup-part-time-salesman-polak-wegier-dwa-46f9d3253430). 
Still cannot remember this song. 

My daughter love The Cars from Pixar. Where a cover of this tune was a prominent feature song. Still nothing. 

Then came the watching of The Office (US) version. To level up my meme game and widen my understanding of the US pop culture. Where this was a feature song that Micheal and Holly sang on the way to their initial break up. That's when it got to me. 

The original is great but I was tempted to look for a harder version.
